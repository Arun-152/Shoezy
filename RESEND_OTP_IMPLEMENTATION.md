# Resend OTP Feature Implementation

## Overview
A complete "Resend OTP" feature has been implemented for the password reset OTP verification page. This feature allows users to request a new OTP if they didn't receive the original one or if it expired.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend Implementation
- **New Route**: `POST /resend-reset-otp` - Handles OTP resend requests
- **Controller Function**: `resendResetOTP` - Generates new OTP and sends email
- **Reuses Existing Logic**: Uses the same `generateOtp()` and `sendPasswordResetOTP()` functions
- **Session Management**: Updates existing session with new OTP and reset expiry

### 2. Frontend Implementation
- **Resend Button**: Added to the OTP verification page
- **30-Second Cooldown**: Prevents spam requests
- **Visual Feedback**: Shows countdown timer during cooldown period
- **AJAX Request**: Uses fetch API for seamless user experience
- **Success/Error Messages**: SweetAlert2 integration for user feedback

### 3. Security Features
- **Cooldown Timer**: 30-second delay between resend requests
- **Session Validation**: Ensures valid OTP session exists before resending
- **User Verification**: Confirms user still exists in database
- **Reset Verification Status**: Clears previous verification when new OTP is sent
- **Timer Reset**: Resets main 5-minute timer when new OTP is sent

## How It Works

### User Flow
1. User is on OTP verification page
2. User clicks "Resend OTP" button
3. Button shows "Sending..." and becomes disabled
4. New OTP is generated and sent to email
5. Success message appears via SweetAlert2
6. OTP input field is cleared
7. Main timer resets to 5 minutes
8. Resend button is hidden and cooldown timer appears
9. After 30 seconds, resend button becomes available again

### Backend Process
1. Validates existing OTP session
2. Confirms user still exists in database
3. Generates new 6-digit OTP using existing `generateOtp()` function
4. Updates session with new OTP and 5-minute expiry
5. Sends email using existing `sendPasswordResetOTP()` function
6. Returns success/error response

## Code Changes

### Controller (`userController.js`)
- Added `resendResetOTP` function
- Reuses existing OTP generation and email sending logic
- Added to module.exports

### Routes (`userRouter.js`)
- Added `POST /resend-reset-otp` route

### View (`verify-reset-otp.ejs`)
- Added resend button with styling
- Added cooldown timer display
- Added JavaScript for AJAX request and cooldown management
- Added CSS styling for resend button and cooldown display

## Security Considerations

### Cooldown Protection
- 30-second cooldown prevents rapid-fire requests
- Button is disabled during cooldown period
- Visual countdown shows remaining time

### Session Security
- Validates existing session before resending
- Resets verification status when new OTP is sent
- Maintains same 5-minute expiry for new OTP

### Rate Limiting
- Natural rate limiting through cooldown timer
- Session-based validation prevents unauthorized requests

## User Experience Features

### Visual Feedback
- Button text changes to "Sending..." during request
- Success message via SweetAlert2
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Cooldown timer with visual countdown

### Automatic Actions
- Clears OTP input field after successful resend
- Resets main timer to 5 minutes
- Auto-focus remains on OTP input

### Accessibility
- Clear button states (enabled/disabled)
- Descriptive text for cooldown period
- Consistent styling with existing design

## Error Handling

### Backend Errors
- No active session: Redirects to start process again
- User not found: Error message with restart suggestion
- Email sending failure: Clear error message with retry option
- Server errors: Generic error message with retry option

### Frontend Errors
- Network errors: User-friendly error message
- Invalid responses: Appropriate error handling
- Cooldown violations: Prevented at UI level

## Integration Notes

- **No Existing Code Modified**: All existing OTP logic remains unchanged
- **Reuses Functions**: Uses existing `generateOtp()` and `sendPasswordResetOTP()`
- **Session Compatible**: Works with existing session structure
- **Design Consistent**: Matches existing UI/UX patterns

## Testing

The resend OTP feature can be tested by:
1. Starting the forgot password process
2. Reaching the OTP verification page
3. Clicking "Resend OTP" button
4. Verifying new OTP is received via email
5. Confirming 30-second cooldown works
6. Testing error scenarios (no session, network errors)

## Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- JavaScript ES6+ features used
- Fetch API for AJAX requests
- CSS3 for styling and transitions

This implementation provides a seamless, secure, and user-friendly way for users to request a new OTP during the password reset process without compromising the existing system's security or functionality.
